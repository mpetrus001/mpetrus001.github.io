	<h2>Hi there, I'm Matthew!</h2>
	<p>
		This is my github.io page that I use to practice new techniques in coding.
		Please don't mind the mess! You can check out the code for this website
		along with some of my other projects at:
		<a href="https://github.com/mpetrus001">github.com/mpetrus001</a>.

	<p>
		I have been pursuing the self-taught approach to learning javascript
		development for over 5 years. Javascript is an amazing language and I
		absolutely heart learning it. When topics range from functional and object
		oriented coding styles, to webpack configs and frameworks, you gotta know
		that you'll never run out of new things to learn.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can check out a few of my projects on the Resume page. If you ever want
		to chat about javascript developement, please feel free to reach out at my
		email link below. I would love the chance to talk more about it!

		Thanks for reading!
