      This is a simple project portfolio website. Github offers static site
      hosting with Jekyll implementation. The site will rebuild upon each commit
      to the remote repository. I chose to pursue this platform as it was freely
      available and allowed me to try out a static site. My favorite feature is
      the ability to add a markdown file to the posts directory from the web-app
      and have the site regenerate automatically.

      The project is a simple task management REST API. By using the API
      endpoints, a user can sign up using an email and password to generates a
      secure token, and use that token to perform CRUD operations on their list
      of tasks which are persisted to a database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The REST API is a Node app writtenusing the NestJS server platform. NestJS
      implements a Module-Controller-Service architecture often seen in
      production-level apps. User authentication is handled with Passport and
      JWT in a Bearer Auth configuration. Entities are persisted to a postgres
      database using a Repository pattern with TypeORM.
    </p>
    <p>
      A frontend SPA using React-Admin has been built; see
      [Task-Management-React](https://github.com/mpetrus001/task-management-react)
      for more details. The project started by completing the coursework for
      [NestJS Zero To Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-zero-to-hero)
      with Ariel Weinberger. Completion of the course resulted in an API server
      about 90% ready for production. Additional features were added to the
      server and the project was "dockerized".

      The project is a simple task management Single Page App. Using the app, a
      user can sign in using an email and password, then perform CRUD operations
      on their list of tasks which are persisted to a database using the REST
      API.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app is built on the React-Admin UI framework which provides a number
      of pre-built components that can be assembled into a full fledged app.
      It's "batteries-included", but allows for a high level of customization.

      The REST API is a Node app written using the NestJS server platform. See
