	<h2>Resume</h2>
	<p>

		copy.

		This is a simple project portfolio website. Github offers static site
		hosting with Jekyll implementation. The site will rebuild upon each commit
		to the remote repository. I chose to pursue this platform as it was freely
		available and allowed me to try out a static site. My favorite feature is
		the ability to add a markdown file to the posts directory from the web-app
		and have the site regenerate automatically.

		A fully extensible Javascript list App that allows the user to create and
		manage multiple lists in a table layout. The view is user customizable, and
		the data is stored browser side using localstorage similar to a PWA. It can
		create instance safe modules of the task table, and relies primarily on pure
		components.

	</h3>
	<p>
		<em>
			<strong>
				Stack: Node, REST API, Puppeteer, Server-Side Rendering, Router,
				Templates, Vanilla JS, PDF Downloads. Async/Promises, Container
			</strong>
		</em>
		My current position requires performing frequent exclusion list searches at
		both the OIG and SAM websites. The web app accepts form input and submits to
		a Node server which performs the searches in parallel using Puppeteer to
		navigate and PDF print the results.
